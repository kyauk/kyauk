Hi! My name is Jason, and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate @ Stanford University. 

My goal is to create technological medical solutions that'll allow for better prognosis and more efficient + accessible medical care globally. I've been primarily exploring and chipping away at this by doing AI/ML works for labs involving in digital pathology, and drug discovery. I'm starting to explore surgical robotics, and patient-first consumer technologies as well. I've also been recently dabbling in wearable data (check my fog repo for more details). In my free time, I like to play basketball, go on runs, soak in nature with hikes, and root for the 49ers on Sundays. Thanks for reading, and it was a pleasure to meet you!
