Hi! My name is Jason, and I'm currently a 3rd year undergraduate @ Stanford University. 

I love to dabble in AI and Medicine, with current more focused interests in CV x Medical Robotics, as well as using biological constraints to solve hard CV problems in the space.

In my free time, I like to play basketball, go on runs, soak in nature with hikes, and root for the 49ers on Sundays.
